# 🍱 Welcome to FounderBento!

### 🌟 Why this is more than another boilerplate 🌟

This is your comprehensive guide to take your idea from zero to hero, not just in code but in executing a successful product launch.

#### 🎯 User Acquisition

What's a great product without users? Actionable guides through proven strategies will get your product in front of the right people, at the right time.

#### 🤖 Leverage AI Tools

Get the most out of AI and automation tools so you can punch way above your weight. You'll have the output _as a solopreneur_ of a designer, content writer, marketer, and a dev team.

#### 🚀 From Start to Scale

FounderBento isn't just a starting point; it's a journey. From cloning this repo today to scaling up tomorrow or pivoting with what you learned from launching, FounderBento provides the roadmap and tools you need. Think of it as your co-pilot, guiding you through every twist and turn, ensuring you not only launch but thrive.

## Start here: Get Your App Running in 5 Minutes

> Clone your new favorite repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitMazzone/founderbento-repo.git <YOUR-APP-NAME>
cd <YOUR-APP-NAME>
npm i
git remote remove origin
npm run dev
```

## Make a Supabase project

We'll use Supabase to handle your database, email logins, social logins, and emails for customer outreach and support. This first step is the bare minimum to get you started, and you can add each piece (or not) as you see fit, or use alternative solutions you prefer.

### On Supabase

> https://supabase.com/

1. Make an account if you don't have one.
2. [Create a new project](https://supabase.com/dashboard) in the Supabase dashboard. It'll look something like this:

<img src={startSbNewProject} width='600' />

3. The very next screen should have two things we want: your `anon public key` and `project URL`:

<img src={startSbKeys} width='600' />

### Update `.env` locally

Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.  
Do not check this file in. It is already in `.gitignore`.

Add your Supabase info from above to `.env.local`:

```bash
# .env.local
# Values found at: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<YOUR-SUPABASE-PROJECT-URL>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR-SUPABASE-ANON-KEY>
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:3000`.

## 📚 What's Next?

You're up and running! Here's what you can look forward to in these docs:

**Launch**: Can you launch with just a landing page and get user feedback ASAP? Here, you'll deploy a beautiful landing page in 15 minutes!  
**Adapt - Features**: Set up features like payments and emails. Used to take hours, now takes minutes.  
**Customize - Components**: Start by launching & getting feedback. Then customize and polish. Responsive, minimal components to speed up your development.  
**Tools**: Productivity tools so useful I regret not creating them myself.

And at each step of the way, guidance on effective execution.
