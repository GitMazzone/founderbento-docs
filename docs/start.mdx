# 🍱 Welcome to FounderBento!

## Quickstart: Get Your App Running in 5 Minutes

> Clone your new favorite repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitMazzone/founderbento-repo.git <YOUR-APP-NAME>
cd <YOUR-APP-NAME>
npm i
git remote remove origin
npm run dev
```

## Make a Supabase project

We'll use Supabase to handle your database, email logins, social logins, and emails for customer outreach and support. This first step is the bare minimum to get you started, and you can add each piece (or not) as you see fit, or use alternative solutions you prefer.

### On Supabase

> https://supabase.com/

1. Make an account if you don't have one.
2. [Create a new project](https://supabase.com/dashboard) in the Supabase dashboard. It'll look something like this:

<img src={startSbNewProject} width='600' />

3. The very next screen should have two things we want: your `anon public key` and `project URL`

<img src={startSbKeys} width='600' />

### Update .env

Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.  
Do not check this file in. It is already in `.gitignore`.

Add your Supabase info from above to `.env.local`:

```bash
# https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<YOUR-SUPABASE-PROJECT-URL>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR-SUPABASE-ANON-KEY>
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:3000`.
